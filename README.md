# Sourcing Cost Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting the sourcing cost for a particular month using provided data. The goal is to develop machine learning models that accurately forecast the sourcing cost based on various features such as product type, manufacturer, area code, and sourcing channel.

## Overview

The project utilizes machine learning techniques, including linear regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and XGBoost regression, to predict the sourcing cost. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Models Used

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regression
- XGBoost Regression

## Graphs and Visualizations

The project includes various graphs and visualizations to analyze the data and model performance:
- Distribution of Sourcing Channels
- Histogram of Sourcing Channel
- Average Sourcing Cost by Manufacturer and Product Type
- Average Sourcing Cost by Product Size
- 'Average Sourcing Cost by Product Type
- Sunburst Graph of Area Code and Sourcing Channel
